# passage-solver
Algo project to solve simple unseen passages given in English exams. 
This project was created just to test implementation of various string matching algorithms, so the program does not offer optimal solutions.
#Objective
  To implement and test various String matching algorithms
#Usage
  Run Solver.java and input the Text passage and set of questions.
  Select any of the algorithms
  The output contains all possible answers based on keywords from question
#Limitations
  Since this program was not written with optimisation in mind so the algorithms take much more time in execution than they should.
  In it's current form this program has no use.
#Future Work
  1. Implement Tokenisation on paragraphs and create index of all the nouns/verbs/adjectives
  2. Use create a training set and implement machine learning to improve predictions with time
  3. Widen the domain of questions answered by using fuzzy search/matching instead of the exact matching currently used.
  4. Implement Natural language processing
  5. Create a Web interface for the same
